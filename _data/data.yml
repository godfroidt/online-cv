    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      At heart, I am a software developer. I have always liked the idea of building
      something new to help people do their work, have fun or do anything meaningful (or less meaningful) with their computers.
      When developing software you learn something new on a daily basis and that keeps the job fun.

      Along the years, I have touched on all aspects of software development. From coding to specifications, to embedded or
      distributed system architecture via setting up tool chains for other developers, support platforms and debug all kinds of
      systems and software stacks.  Each job has been a new experience in a new industry which is, perhaps, what makes software
      development so fun to me: it's still software and it's never the same thing!

      I have also been a team lead & manager for quite a few years now. In that role, I try to build
      well balanced teams, based on trust and responsibility, to help people focus on their job and grow as they fell like.
      I believe in clear, honest and well-meaning management, providing a "safe" place for team members to excel at what they do.
